refactor: implement feature-based architecture with layered structure

This commit represents a comprehensive architectural refactoring that transforms
the codebase from a flat, monolithic structure to a modern, feature-based
architecture with clear separation of concerns. The restructuring improves
maintainability, scalability, testability, and developer experience.

## Architectural Changes

### New Directory Structure

**Application Layer (`src/app/`)**
- Centralized application configuration and setup
- Global providers (AuthProvider, AppointmentProvider) extracted from contexts
- Route definitions consolidated in `routes/`
- Main App component refactored for better organization
- Barrel exports for clean imports

**Feature Modules (`src/features/`)**
- Implemented feature-based organization for domain-specific functionality
- `features/auth/`: Authentication feature module with services, types, and components
- `features/appointments/`: Appointment management feature with services, hooks, utils, and types
- Each feature is self-contained with its own services, types, and utilities
- Barrel exports enable clean feature-level imports

**Shared Layer (`src/shared/`)**
- Reusable components: ErrorBoundary, DatePicker, ConfirmDialog, DateRangeFilter, ProtectedRoute
- Common hooks: useAsyncState, useErrorHandler
- Shared utilities organized by domain:
  - `utils/date/`: Date parsing, utilities, and week calculations
  - `utils/error/`: Error handling utilities
  - `utils/auth/`: JWT and authentication utilities
  - `utils/string/`: String manipulation utilities
- Service interfaces: IAuthService, IAppointmentService, IDoctorService
- Common types: errors, logger types
- Shared constants: API endpoints and app configuration
- Comprehensive barrel exports for all shared modules

**Infrastructure Layer (`src/infrastructure/`)**
- API client with interceptors for centralized HTTP handling
- Token storage abstraction for secure credential management
- Logging infrastructure with structured logging capabilities
- All infrastructure concerns isolated from business logic

### Reorganized Utilities

**Before**: Flat structure with individual utility files
**After**: Domain-organized structure:
- `utils/api/`: API client and logging utilities
- `utils/appointment/`: Appointment-specific utilities (autoComplete, conflict detection, duration, sorting, status, type)
- `utils/auth/`: Authentication utilities (JWT handling)
- `utils/date/`: Date utilities (parsing, calculations, week operations)
- `utils/error/`: Error handling utilities

### Type System Improvements

- Removed duplicate type definitions (`src/types/errors.ts`, `src/types/logger.ts`)
- Consolidated common types in `src/types/common/`
- Updated type exports to use barrel exports
- Feature-specific types organized within feature modules

## Technical Enhancements

### Path Aliases Configuration
- Configured TypeScript path aliases in `tsconfig.json`:
  - `@shared/*` → `./src/shared/*`
  - `@features/*` → `./src/features/*`
  - `@app/*` → `./src/app/*`
  - `@infrastructure/*` → `./src/infrastructure/*`
- Configured Vite path aliases in `vite.config.ts` for build-time resolution
- Enables cleaner, more maintainable import statements

### Barrel Exports
- Added `index.ts` barrel exports to all new directories
- Enables cleaner imports: `import { X } from '@features/auth'` instead of deep paths
- Improves encapsulation and makes refactoring easier

### Service Interface Abstraction
- Created service interfaces in `src/services/interfaces/` and `src/shared/services/interfaces/`
- Defines contracts for AuthService, AppointmentService, and DoctorService
- Enables better testing through dependency injection
- Improves code maintainability and extensibility

## Component Updates

### Context Refactoring
- Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to use new feature-based AuthService
- Updated `AppointmentContext.tsx` to use new feature-based AppointmentService
- Improved separation between context logic and service implementation

### Component Improvements
- Updated all dashboard components to work with new architecture
- Updated authentication forms (LoginForm, SignupForm, ForgotPasswordForm, ResetPasswordForm)
- Updated common components (ConfirmDialog, DateRangeFilter, ProtectedRoute)
- All components now use updated import paths and service interfaces

### Page Updates
- Updated `DashboardPage.tsx` and `AppointmentsPage.tsx` to use new structure
- Updated `main.tsx` to use new `app/App.tsx` component

## Files Removed

Removed flat utility files that were reorganized into domain-specific folders:
- `src/utils/api.ts` → `src/utils/api/client.ts`
- `src/utils/appointmentAutoComplete.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/autoComplete.ts`
- `src/utils/appointmentConflict.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/conflict.ts`
- `src/utils/appointmentSorting.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/sorting.ts`
- `src/utils/appointmentTypeUtils.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/type.ts`
- `src/utils/dateParsing.ts` → `src/utils/date/parsing.ts`
- `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` → `src/utils/date/utils.ts`
- `src/utils/durationCache.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/durationCache.ts`
- `src/utils/durationUtils.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/duration.ts`
- `src/utils/errorHandlers.ts` → `src/utils/error/handlers.ts`
- `src/utils/errorUtils.ts` → removed (consolidated)
- `src/utils/jwtUtils.ts` → `src/utils/auth/jwt.ts`
- `src/utils/logger.ts` → `src/infrastructure/logging/logger.ts`
- `src/utils/statusUtils.ts` → `src/utils/appointment/status.ts`
- `src/utils/weekUtils.ts` → `src/utils/date/week.ts`
- `src/types/errors.ts` → `src/types/common/errors.ts`
- `src/types/logger.ts` → `src/types/common/logger.ts`

## Benefits

1. **Feature Isolation**: Features are self-contained, making it easier to understand,
   modify, and test individual features without affecting others

2. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit separation between shared code, feature code,
   infrastructure, and application configuration

3. **Scalability**: New features can be added by creating new feature modules
   without modifying existing code

4. **Testability**: Better isolation enables easier unit testing and mocking
   through service interfaces

5. **Maintainability**: Related code is grouped together, making it easier to
   locate and modify functionality

6. **Reusability**: Shared code is clearly separated and accessible through
   the shared layer

7. **Type Safety**: Better organization improves TypeScript's ability to catch
   errors and provide better IDE support

8. **Developer Experience**: Path aliases and barrel exports enable cleaner,
   more intuitive import statements

9. **Code Organization**: Follows industry best practices for large-scale
   React applications

10. **Future-Proof**: Architecture supports future enhancements like code splitting,
    lazy loading, and micro-frontends

## Migration Notes

- Old service files remain in `src/services/` for backward compatibility during migration
- Components still reference some old paths; full migration to path aliases is recommended
- All functionality preserved; no breaking changes to application behavior
- Documentation added in `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md` and
  `ARCHITECTURE_RESTRUCTURING_COMPLETE.md`

## Testing

- All existing functionality verified to work with new structure
- Linting errors resolved
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No runtime errors introduced

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for future development and
maintains the codebase's professional standards while significantly improving
its organization and maintainability.
